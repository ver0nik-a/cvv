## About me

It is customary to begin a story about yourself with an introduction. So, Iâ€™m Veronika Goncharova. I was born on October 22, 2004 in city called Beshenkovichi, the Republic of Belarus.

Now I am studying at Vsu in the specialty information resource management. I am finishing my first yea, the education lasts 4 years in total. I was enrolled on a budget basis at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Technology.

A specialist of this specialty can work in various sectors of the economy: industry, banking, logistics and insurance companies, advertising enterprises, international and foreign organizations as a manager, economist, IT specialist and in other managerial positions.

I didn't even know about this specialty, but having accidentally stumbled upon it, having learned more about it without hesitation, I decided to enroll here. I am happy with my choice.
